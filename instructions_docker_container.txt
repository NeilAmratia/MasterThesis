OPTION 1:
# BCS framework along with BCS Simulator can run using Docker Images (simple and preferred way, but requires download of images from docker hub)

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Access to Docker Hub

## Steps to Use the Framework and Simulator

### 1. Pull the Docker Images
Pull the prebuilt Docker images from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull amratianeil/bcs_framework:latest
docker pull amratianeil/bcs_simulator:latest

### 2. create a network for interaction between the 2 docker containers
create docker network:
```bash
docker network create bcs_network

### 3. open a terminal to run the framework container:
Start the BCS framework container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network bcs_network amratianeil/bcs_framework:latest

### 4. open another terminal to run the simulator container:
Start the BCS simulator container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --net bcs_network -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 amratianeil/bcs_simulator:latest

Congratulations!!!! you have both containers running now. Please follow the instructions mentioned in bcs_framework and bcs_simulator folder for details

OPTION 2:
# BCS framework along with BCS Simulator can run using Docker files (requires some extra work and patience)

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- directories containing bcs_framework and bcs_simulator must be present in local drive

## Steps to Use the Framework and Simulator

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory in this case to bcs_framework:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile. For example:
```bash
cd /path/to/bcs_framework

### 2. Build the Docker Image:
```bash
docker build -t bcs_framework:latest .

### 3. Verify the Image Build:
```bash
docker images

### 4. follow the same process from ### 1 to ### 3 for bcs_simulator in another terminal
Start the BCS simulator container interactively:
```bash
cd /path/to/bcs_simulator
docker build -t bcs_simulator:latest .

### 5. create a network for interaction between the 2 docker containers
create docker network:
```bash
docker network create bcs_network

### 6. open a terminal to run the framework container:
Start the BCS framework container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network bcs_network bcs_framework:latest

### 7. open another terminal to run the simulator container:
Start the BCS simulator container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --net bcs_network -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 bcs_simulator:latest

Congratulations!!!! you have both containers running now. Please follow the instructions mentioned in bcs_framework and bcs_simulator folder for details

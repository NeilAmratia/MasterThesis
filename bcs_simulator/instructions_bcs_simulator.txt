#Instructions to Run the bcs_simulator Docker File in an Interactive Window

Step 1: Install X Server for GUI Support
The bcs_simulator application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Qt. To enable GUI support when running the Docker container, an X Server application like XLaunch is required to forward the graphical display from the container to the host machine.

What is XLaunch?
XLaunch is an X Server for Windows that allows Linux GUI applications (running in Docker or WSL) to display on your Windows system.

Where to Download XLaunch?
Download XLaunch from the official Xming (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) website. Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.

How to Set Up XLaunch?
Install XLaunch on your system.
Run XLaunch and configure it:
Select "Multiple windows" or "One large window" as the display mode.
Ensure "No Access Control" is checked to allow connections from the container.

Setting DISPLAY Variable
Before running the Docker container, set the DISPLAY variable on your system. On Windows, it is typically:
- set DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0

Step 2: Start the Docker Container (please see the instructions present in the parent folder):
- docker run -it --rm --net bcs_network -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 amratianeil/bcs_simulator:latest

Step 3: Build and Source the bcs_simulator Package
- cd /ros2_ws
- colcon build --packages-select bcs_simulator
- source install/setup.bash

Step 4: Run the bcs_simulator Application
- ros2 run bcs_simulator bcs_simulator

Step 5: Run the test cases for input_configuration file
- ros2 run bcs_simulator bcs_test_suite path/to/input_configuration.xml

( Example: ros2 run bcs_simulator bcs_test_suite input_config/LLM/input_configuration_4.xml)

Important Notes:-
Ensure XLaunch is Running: Before executing the bcs_simulator application, verify that XLaunch is running and configured with "No Access Control."
Network Configuration: If the container cannot communicate with the host's display, ensure that the DISPLAY variable is correctly set and accessible.
Test the Display: You can test if the display is working by running the following command in the container:
- xeyes
This should open a graphical window on your host machine.
